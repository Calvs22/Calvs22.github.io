    <p id="par"> Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the largest country by area in Oceania and the worldâ€™s sixth-largest country. Australia is the oldest, flattest, and driest inhabited continent, with the least fertile soils. It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, tropical savannas in the north, and mountain ranges in the south-east.</p>

    <p id="par">The capital of Australia is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The official languages are English. As of 2023, it has a population of approximately 26.8 million.</p>
