    <p id="par">Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: República Federativa do Brasil), is the largest country in South America and in Latin America1. It is the world’s fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous1. Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo1. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District.</p>

    <p id="par">Brazil is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language1. It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world1, and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.</p>
        
    <p id="par">Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi)1. It borders all other countries and territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers roughly half of the continent’s land area1. Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats.</p>
